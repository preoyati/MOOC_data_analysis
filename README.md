Predicting user behavior in Massive Open Online Course: 
In this project after collecting data from MOOC websites I analyzed them to find if any user needs any help from a Professor. I have created list of attributes for arff file by this python code. Where attributes are unique words in the data set. After that this code creates appropriate data to train a machine. This data is used by some popular machine learning algorithm from WEKA to train and test a machine. At the end the machine can predict the user behavior.
